# HomeMatic_DLL
Hi there! This repository consists of a C# project. Its purpose is to communicate with a HomeMatic device which is able to control a bunch of actuators via radio waves. HomeMatic_DLL is a class library which communicates via XML-RPC over Ethernet with the previously stated HomeMatic device.

I put the executable project HomeMatic_EXE into a class library for a more convenient usage.
